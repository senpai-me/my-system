The Complete History of Christ the Redeemer: An Icon of Brazil
Standing atop the 2,300-foot summit of Mount Corcovado, Christ the Redeemer (Cristo Redentor) is more than just a monument; it is a global symbol of peace, a feat of 20th-century engineering, and one of the New Seven Wonders of the World. Completed in 1931, the statue’s journey from a priest’s dream to a 635-metric-ton reality is a story of faith, international collaboration, and architectural brilliance.
1. The Early Concept (1850s – 1880s)
The vision for a monument on Corcovado did not originate in the 1920s, but nearly 70 years earlier. In the mid-1850s, a Vincentian priest named Pedro Maria Boss suggested placing a religious monument on the mountain to honor Princess Isabel, the regent of Brazil.
While the Princess was a devout Catholic, she declined the personal tribute. She instead requested that if a monument were built, it should be dedicated to Jesus Christ, whom she regarded as the "true Redeemer." However, after the Proclamation of the Republic in 1889, Brazil transitioned to a secular government, and the project was officially dismissed for decades.
2. A Religious Revival (1920 – 1922)
Following World War I, the Catholic Circle of Rio de Janeiro became concerned about a perceived "tide of godlessness" in the city. To reclaim the spiritual identity of the nation, they revived the idea of the statue.
In 1921, the church organized "Monument Week" (Semana do Monumento), a massive fundraising drive. The Brazilian people donated the entire cost of the project—approximately $250,000 (roughly $4 million today)—meaning the statue was built entirely through private faith-based contributions rather than government funds.
3. Designing the Icon
The design we see today was not the original plan. Engineer Heitor da Silva Costa, who won the project competition, initially envisioned Christ holding a large cross in one hand and a celestial globe in the other. This design was nicknamed "Christ with a ball" by the public.
To make the monument more symbolic, Silva Costa collaborated with Brazilian artist Carlos Oswald. They simplified the design into an Art Deco masterpiece: Christ himself would be the cross, with his arms outstretched to symbolize a blessing over the city and a message of peace.
4. An International Collaboration
While the project was Brazilian in spirit, it was international in execution:
Engineering: Heitor da Silva Costa oversaw the project, choosing reinforced concrete for the structure—a revolutionary choice at the time for a monument of this scale.
Sculpting the Head and Hands: The French-Polish sculptor Paul Landowski was commissioned to create the statue's most detailed parts. He modeled the head and hands in clay in his Paris studio, which were then shipped to Rio in sections.
The Face: Romanian sculptor Gheorghe Leonida was chosen by Landowski to carve the delicate features of Christ’s face, ensuring a look of serenity and compassion.
5. The Construction Phase (1922 – 1931)
Construction began on April 4, 1922. The logistics were a nightmare: all materials, including the massive concrete ribs and the workers themselves, had to be transported up the mountain via a small cogwheel railway.
One of the most distinct features of the statue is its "skin." Silva Costa worried that plain concrete would look unfinished and be prone to cracking. He decided to cover the statue in a mosaic of six million soapstone tiles. Soapstone was chosen for its resistance to extreme weather and its soft, ethereal glow under moonlight. Local women reportedly spent months gluing the tiles onto linen sheets, which were then applied to the statue.
6. The Grand Inauguration
On October 12, 1931, the statue was officially inaugurated. In a display of early 20th-century technology, the lighting of the statue was supposed to be triggered by a radio signal sent by the Italian inventor Guglielmo Marconi from his yacht in Naples, Italy. While weather issues caused some interference, the lights eventually flickered on, signaling the birth of Brazil's most famous landmark.
7. The Statue Today
Today, Christ the Redeemer stands 98 feet (30 meters) tall, not including its 26-foot (8-meter) pedestal. Its arm span reaches 92 feet (28 meters).
Lightning Strikes: Due to its position, the statue is struck by lightning 3 to 6 times every year. It has a sophisticated system of lightning rods to prevent damage, though the fingertips have required repair several times.
World Heritage: In 2007, it was voted one of the New Seven Wonders of the World alongside the Great Wall of China and the Taj Mahal. In 2012, UNESCO listed the landscape around the statue as a World Heritage site.
A century after its first stone was laid, Christ the Redeemer remains an engineering marvel and a timeless beacon of the "City of Wonders."
